Scholary papers describing the methodology
========================================================

```{r setup, include = FALSE, cache = FALSE}
library("RefManageR")
bib <- ReadBib("mvtnorm.bib", check = FALSE)
BibOptions(check.entries = FALSE, style = "html", cite.style = "authoryear",
           bib.style = "numeric")
```
The mvtnorm package implements methods to evaluate the probability, density, and quantile
functions of the multivariate normal and t distributions. For the general case, tailored
Monte Carlo methods described by `r Citet(bib, "Genz_Bretz_2009")` are applied; for the
bivariate normal the exact approach by `r Citet(bib, "Miwa_Hayter_Kuriki_2003")` is available 
as an alternative.
